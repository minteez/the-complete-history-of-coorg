          <p>
            Kodagu is small, and much of what is written about it online is repeated without
            attribution: dates that contradict each other, origin stories presented as settled fact,
            colonial anecdotes recycled as record. This archive was built to gather the same material
            carefully — naming sources, marking what is documented, and saying plainly when
            historians disagree.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not an official publication of any institution or community body. It is a research
            project, open to correction, and it aims to be useful to students, visitors and Kodavas
            looking for something more solid than a summary.

              Prehistory and megalithic burials, early dynastic overlordship, the Haleri kingdom, the

              coffee, Coorg State and the 1956 merger — alongside Kodava community life, festivals,
              agriculture, military service, Kodava Takk and its literature.

            Created by Minteez, a developer from Coorg, as a digital archive dedicated to his
            homeland. The work — research, writing, design and engineering — was done as an
            independent side project.
