              Under the Haleri rajas and then the British, land in Kodagu was held under distinctive
              tenures that tied families to particular valleys. Rice fields could not easily be
              enlarged; plantations could, and the nineteenth-century expansion of coffee therefore
              pushed into forest rather than replacing paddy.
            </p>
            <p>
              That expansion brought migrant labour into the district, reorganised the forest
              administration, and made Kodagu's prosperity dependent on commodity prices set in
              Europe. Its consequences — labour settlements, reserved forest, plantation
              smallholdings — are visible in the district today.

            Area and yield figures for coffee and pepper move year to year with rainfall, price and
            replanting. This archive avoids quoting a single tonnage as though it were a historical
            fact; the Coffee Board and district statistics are the place to check the current number.
