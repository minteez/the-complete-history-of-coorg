              The most visible antiquities are megalithic: dolmens of upright slabs capped by a
              horizontal stone, cairns and stone circles, generally associated with the South Indian
              Iron Age. They mark the dead, not settlements, so they tell us about ritual and social
              organisation more readily than about population or economy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Local tradition often attributes these monuments to a race of giants or to earlier
              peoples displaced by the Kodavas. That belongs to tradition, not to archaeology, and
              this archive keeps the two apart.

            <p>
              Sangam Tamil poetry mentions hill peoples and places that some scholars connect to
              Kodagu, and the name Kudagu is often read as an early form. The identifications are
              plausible but not secure: the poems are not geographies, and the readings depend on
              later commentary.

            <p>
              From roughly the ninth century onwards, epigraphy from the Kannada and Malabar
              borderlands begins to name chiefs, temples and grants in and around these hills. It
              shows overlordship shifting between larger powers rather than a single continuous
              Kodagu polity.
