              Existing structures were kept where they were useful. Nad and village headmen
              continued to collect revenue and settle small disputes, now answerable to a district
              officer rather than a raja. Kodava landholding was recognised in a distinctive form of
              tenure, and the community's right to carry arms was allowed to continue — a privilege
              later confirmed by exemption under Indian arms legislation.

              The 1837 rising in Amara Sullia showed how thin the new authority was in the western
              lowlands. It was suppressed, and afterwards the administration concentrated on roads,
              survey, forest reservation and revenue settlement, which together opened the highlands
              to planters.

            Coffee had been grown in the region before the annexation, but from roughly the 1850s
            European planters and then Kodava landowners expanded it rapidly. Forest was converted to
            shade plantation, migrant labour arrived from the plains and from Malabar, and Kodagu's
            fortunes became tied to a commodity price set elsewhere.

          <p>
            Paddy remained the food crop and the social anchor; coffee, pepper and cardamom became
            the cash. Kodagu is still one of India's principal coffee districts, which is why the
            nineteenth-century plantation map is legible on the ground today.

              These documents were written to govern. Plantation labourers, tenants and
              non-landholding communities appear mostly as numbers, and the justification for the
              1834 annexation is repeated in them as settled fact. This archive marks such passages
              as colonial accounts rather than plain history.
