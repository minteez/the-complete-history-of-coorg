            The Company's stated grounds were the raja's misrule and his refusal to surrender a
            relative who had taken refuge in British territory. Both appear in the official record;
            both were also convenient. Annexation completed British control of the passes between the
            Mysore plateau and the Malabar coast.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the surrender the raja was removed with his household to Benares. Coorg was
            administered as a small non-regulation province, initially under a Commissioner
            answering to the Madras and later the Mysore establishment.

              A revolt three years later in the Amara Sullia country against Company taxation and
              administration, involving people from Kodagu and the adjoining South Canara tracts. It
              briefly took Mangaluru before being suppressed. It was not a continuation of the royal
              cause and is often wrongly folded into the 1834 story.
