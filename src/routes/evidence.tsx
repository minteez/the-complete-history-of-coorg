              Accounts tracing Kodava origins to Chandravarma, to Alexander's soldiers, to Scythians
              or to Arab migrants circulate widely. They are traditions and hypotheses of varying
              age and credibility, not established findings, and are labelled accordingly.

            <p>
              Figures such as the number of Kodavas deported during Tipu Sultan's campaigns come
              largely from later British and missionary writing. The archive reports the range given
              by sources and flags that the totals are contested.

          <InfoPanel title="Dates that don't agree" tone="forest">
            <p>
              Haleri regnal dates differ between gazetteers, dynastic lists and modern studies. Where
              they conflict, the archive gives the competing dates instead of picking one silently.
