              Kailpodhud and Kaveri Sankramana are usually fixed to the solar calendar and fall on
              nearly the same day each year; Puttari follows the lunar month and the ripening of the
              crop, so it shifts. Local announcements, not this page, are the authority for a given
              year.

              Village temple festivals, Kodava participation in wider Hindu festivals, and okka-level
              rites at the kaimada all sit alongside the three. Listing only three is a convention of
              summary, not a complete calendar.
