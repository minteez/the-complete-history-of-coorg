              The rajas are generally described as a branch of the Keladi–Ikkeri house who
              established themselves at Haleri and gradually brought the nads — the country's
              territorial divisions — under a single authority. Rule was never absolute: the okkas
              and their headmen retained considerable local standing, and the kingdom governed
              through them rather than over them.

              Under Mudduraja the seat moved to a new settlement that became Madikeri, fortified and
              refortified over the following century. Later rulers extended control toward the
              lowland frontiers, which is where friction with Mysore began.

              The 19th-century gazetteers built their king-lists from palace records, oral testimony
              and Company correspondence gathered after the conquest. Community compilations draw on
              family memory and temple records. Where the two disagree — and for the earlier reigns
              they often do by a decade or more — this archive gives the range instead of choosing.

              Almost everything written about Chikka Vira Rajendra comes from officials who wanted
              him removed. His deposition may still have been popular in parts of the country; the
              point is that the evidence is not neutral.
