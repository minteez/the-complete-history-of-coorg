            Elections were held for a small legislature, and C. M. Poonacha headed the government as
            chief minister. The state's revenue came largely from coffee and forest; its
            administrative machinery was inherited almost intact from the colonial province.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coorg's leaders were divided over its future. One current argued that a district of this
            size could not sustain statehood; another held that separate status protected a distinct
            language and land tenure. Both arguments were made in public and both are documented — the
            question of what Kodagu lost or gained in 1956 remains a live political argument rather
            than a settled historical judgement.

              The States Reorganisation Act, 1956 redrew India's map on largely linguistic lines.
              Coorg State was abolished and its territory became Coorg district of the enlarged
              Mysore State — Karnataka from 1973, the same year the district's own name, Kodagu,
              replaced the anglicised Coorg in official use.

              Kodagu today is a district of Karnataka with two revenue subdivisions and its
              headquarters at Madikeri. Kodava Takk is not a scheduled language, and campaigns for
              statehood, autonomy or greater recognition of the language recur; this archive records
              them as ongoing claims, not outcomes.
