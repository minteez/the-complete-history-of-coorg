            Kodagu's value to Mysore was strategic rather than economic: the passes through these
            hills linked the Mysore plateau to the Malabar coast. Control of Kodagu meant control of
            the route, which is why the campaigns were persistent out of all proportion to the
            country's size.
          </p>
          <p>
            Resistance was decentralised — ambushes on columns moving through forest and defile
            rather than pitched battle — and that pattern became central to how Kodavas later
            described their own military tradition.

              Figures given in different sources range from a few thousand to seventy thousand or
              more. The highest come from Company-era accounts and Tipu's own correspondence, both
              written to impress readers — one with atrocity, the other with success. Modern
              historians treat the largest numbers as implausible against any reasonable estimate of
              Kodagu's population at the time.

              What is not in doubt is that the deportations, forced conversions and reprisals of this
              period left a lasting mark on Kodava memory, and that survivors and escapees formed
              the core of the force that restored the Haleri line.

            Dodda Vira Rajendra escaped captivity, gathered support in the hills and, with Company
            backing during the wars against Tipu, recovered the kingdom. A treaty relationship
            followed. Kodagu emerged intact and nominally independent, but tied to a power whose
            interest in the passes was the same as Mysore's had been.
