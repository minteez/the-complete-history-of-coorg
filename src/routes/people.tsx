              An <strong>okka</strong> is a patrilineal joint family holding ancestral land and name
              in common. Membership passes through the father's line; marriage within the okka is
              prohibited. The okka's ritual centre is the <strong>ainmane</strong>, the ancestral
              house, where births, marriages, death rites and festivals are observed and where the
              ancestors are addressed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Above the okka sat the <strong>nad</strong>, a grouping of villages with its own
              headman — the unit through which the Haleri kingdom and later the British
              administration actually governed. Land tenure in Kodagu was recognised in distinctive
              forms, and land, clan and identity are difficult to separate in the historical record.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kodagu's population also includes Kodava-speaking and Kannada-speaking communities of
              many kinds — Amma Kodava, Airi, Kembatti, Kudiya, Yerava, Kuruba and Gowda groups,
              Moplah and Muslim traders, Tulu and Malayali settlers, and the labour communities that
              came with coffee. Writing only about the Kodava would misdescribe the district.

              Descent from Alexander's Greeks, from Scythians, from Arabs, from Kshatriya migrants
              from the north — each has been proposed, repeated in print, and none is supported by
              evidence that historians or geneticists treat as decisive. They are usually
              nineteenth- and twentieth-century constructions rather than old traditions.

              Kodava Takk is a Dravidian language of the South Dravidian group, and the community's
              institutions, kinship terms and ritual vocabulary are of a piece with the western
              Ghats region. Long local continuity is a reasonable reading of the linguistic and
              archaeological evidence; a distant single origin is not.
